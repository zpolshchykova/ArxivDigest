  I am an experimental physicist focused on quantum optics, quantum information, and integrated photonics.
  I prefer experimental demonstrations, hardware, and measurement-oriented papers.

  Prioritize papers about:
  - quantum optics experiments (DV and CV), entanglement generation, squeezing, homodyne/heterodyne detection
  - photonic quantum information: QKD implementations, quantum networking, interfaces, frequency conversion
  - integrated quantum photonics (LNOI/TFLN, Si/SiN, AlN, diamond, InP): on-chip sources, interferometers, resonators
  - nonlinear processes for quantum light: SPDC, SFWM, SHG, quantum frequency conversion
  - single-photon detectors and experimental techniques relevant to photonic quantum experiments (e.g., SNSPDs)
  - light–matter interfaces with an experimental angle (color centers, cavity QED in photonic platforms)

  Also prioritize topics aligned with Rachel Grange–adjacent experimental photonics/quantum photonics themes:
  - microcavities, nanophotonic resonators, enhanced nonlinear/quantum emission in resonant structures
  - integrated photonics enabling strong light–matter interaction and quantum optical functionality

  De-prioritize:
  - purely theoretical quantum information (algorithms/complexity) with no clear experimental implementation path
  - foundational discussions without experimental proposals or measurable outcomes
