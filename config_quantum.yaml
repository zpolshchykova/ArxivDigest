  IMPORTANT: A paper is relevant if it matches ANY ONE of the items below.
  It does NOT need to satisfy all criteria.

  I am an experimental physicist in quantum optics and integrated photonics.
  Platforms: LNOI/TFLN (LiNbO3), Si/SiN integrated photonics.

  Relevant if it includes any of:
  - integrated quantum photonics, photonic quantum information
  - on-chip quantum light sources, entanglement, squeezing
  - SPDC / SFWM / frequency conversion / χ(2) nonlinear optics (especially LiNbO3 / PPLN / TFLN)
  - photonic interfaces, quantum networking components, frequency translation, telecom compatibility
  - experimental demonstrations, device implementations, measurement setups, detectors, characterization

  Theory is OK if it has a clear experimental pathway or device relevance.
