  I am an experimental physicist working on quantum optics and integrated photonics
  (especially thin-film lithium niobate / LNOI / TFLN).

  Prioritize experimental and implementation-focused papers in:
  - photonic quantum information, integrated quantum photonics
  - quantum light sources, entanglement, frequency conversion, SPDC/SFWM, PPLN
  - device-focused or measurement/instrumentation work that supports experiments

  De-prioritize purely theoretical/formal papers without a clear experimental pathway.
