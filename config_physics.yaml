  I am an experimental physicist working in integrated photonics and quantum optics.
  My main platforms include thin-film lithium niobate (LNOI / TFLN) and silicon photonics (Si/SiN),
  and I care about experimentally demonstrated devices and measurements.

  Prioritize papers with experimental results related to:
  - integrated photonics / nanophotonics / photonic integrated circuits (PICs)
  - thin-film lithium niobate (LNOI/TFLN), PPLN, electro-optic modulators, χ(2) nonlinear optics
  - silicon photonics / silicon nitride (SiN), low-loss waveguides, microresonators, ring resonators
  - nonlinear and quantum photonics on-chip: SPDC, SFWM, SHG, OPO, frequency conversion, frequency combs
  - integrated single-photon sources (including color centers / emitters), entangled photon sources, squeezing
  - cavities and resonators: whispering-gallery, microrings, photonic crystals, high-Q resonators
  - optical measurement/instrumentation relevant to photonics experiments: interferometry, spectroscopy, metrology, detectors
  - packaging and coupling: fiber-to-chip coupling, grating couplers, edge coupling, alignment, stability

  Also prioritize work aligned with topics commonly appearing in Rachel Grange’s research area:
  - nanophotonics and integrated photonics for light–matter interaction
  - microcavities and resonant enhancement
  - nonlinear nanophotonics / frequency conversion
  - quantum/semiconductor emitters coupled to photonic structures
  - integrated devices enabling quantum optics experiments

  De-prioritize:
  - purely theoretical/formal work without a clear experimental pathway or measurable predictions
  - papers that are mainly about a specific human language or NLP datasets
  - work unrelated to photonics/optics experiments (e.g., high-energy theory, cosmology, etc.)
