interest: |
  I am an experimental physicist focused on quantum optics and integrated photonics,
  especially thin-film lithium niobate (LNOI / TFLN).

  Prioritize papers about:
  - integrated photonics / integrated quantum photonics
  - thin-film lithium niobate / LNOI / TFLN devices (modulators, resonators, PPLN, frequency conversion, combs)
  - quantum optics experiments, sources, detectors, characterization, packaging, fabrication that enable experiments

  De-prioritize:
  - purely theoretical papers with no experimental demonstration, no clear experimental proposal, or no device/measurement relevance
  - papers focused mainly on a specific human language (e.g., Arabic-only NLP, Chinese-only NLP, etc.)
