  IMPORTANT: A paper is relevant if it matches ANY ONE of the items below.
  It does NOT need to satisfy all criteria.

  I work in integrated photonics and quantum optics (experimental), mainly:
  - thin-film lithium niobate (LNOI / TFLN / LiNbO3)
  - silicon photonics and silicon nitride (Si / SiN)

  Strong keywords / topics (any of these is enough):
  - lithium niobate, LiNbO3, LNOI, TFLN, PPLN
  - Pockels effect, electro-optic modulation, EO modulators
  - nonlinear photonics: χ(2), χ(3), SHG, OPO, frequency conversion, frequency combs
  - integrated photonics / photonic integrated circuits, waveguides, microrings, microresonators, high-Q resonators
  - quantum photonics: SPDC, SFWM, squeezing, entanglement, single photons, integrated quantum photonics
  - packaging / coupling / measurement: fiber-to-chip coupling, grating couplers, edge coupling, characterization, metrology, detectors

  Also relevant if it overlaps with topics commonly appearing in Rachel Grange’s area:
  - nanophotonics, microcavities, resonant enhancement, nonlinear nanophotonics, light–matter interaction, emitters coupled to photonics

  Theory papers are OK if they clearly connect to experiments, devices, or measurable predictions.
