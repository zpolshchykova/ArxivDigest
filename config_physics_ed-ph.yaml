interest: |
  I am an experimental physicist in integrated photonics and quantum optics.

  Prioritize only if it is about:
  - Teaching laboratories / demonstrations involving optics, photonics, lasers, interferometry
  - Quantum optics / quantum information teaching experiments (hands-on, lab-focused)

  Deprioritize:
  - General pedagogy papers unrelated to optics/quantum labs
