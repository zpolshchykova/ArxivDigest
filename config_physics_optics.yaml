  I am an experimental physicist working in integrated photonics, especially lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI).

  Prioritize:
  - Integrated photonics / photonic integrated circuits (PICs)
  - Thin-film LiNbO3 / LNOI devices and electro-optic modulation
  - Integrated nonlinear optics: SHG, SPDC, OPO, frequency conversion, combs
  - Integrated quantum photonics / quantum optics experiments implemented with photonics
    (single photons, entanglement, squeezing, homodyne, quantum frequency conversion)

  Deprioritize:
  - Purely theoretical optics papers with no realistic experimental validation
  - Papers that are mainly about a specific natural language / NLP / unrelated “optics” metaphor usage
