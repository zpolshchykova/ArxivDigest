  I am an experimental physicist; I only want history/philosophy papers if they connect to:
  - History of optics / lasers / quantum optics
  - History of quantum information with clear relevance to experiments or photonics

  Deprioritize:
  - Broad philosophy papers without a clear connection to optics/quantum optics
