  I am an experimental physicist working in integrated photonics, especially lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI).

  Prioritize:
  - Integrated photonics and nanophotonics devices (especially LNOI / LiNbO3)
  - Electro-optic modulators, resonators (microrings), waveguides, couplers, gratings
  - Photonic integrated circuit fabrication, packaging, characterization
  - Nonlinear optics on chip (SHG, SPDC, frequency conversion) when experimentally demonstrated

  Deprioritize:
  - Pure theory with no clear experimental path or device relevance
  - Papers focused mainly on non-photonics applications (unless clearly transferrable to integrated photonics)
